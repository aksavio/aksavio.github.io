Moreover, it requires user participation which involves a user voluntarily giving up their data (Location, travel routs, people you have interacted with etc). Many would not be willing to share this information. The safety and the good use of this information sometimes also remains in question, some of this contact tracing technologies are closed source hence the people don’t actually know what data is being sent where. Keeping all of this sensitive data on citizens at one place is dangerous. Even big companies like Facebook who have a big security infrastructure has had multiple data leaks a year.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id='logical-assumption'><span>Logical Assumption</span></h2><p><span>People move out of the house to buy the essentials at a certain time of day or when the weather is good.</span></p><h2 id='what-is-the-premise-of-my-app'><span>What is the premise of my app?</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>Distribution of crowds</span></p><ul><li><span>It will evenly distribute the people going to certain places.

<span>Local stores could be on the app where people could pay for things and would just need to go and pick them up from the store minimizing the time spent at the store.</span>
<span>Features could be added, one could add their destination of where they would like chemist or workplace etc.</span></p><p><img src="html\images\img3.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="img3"></p><p><span>Furthermore I would like to add that the data of the people be distributed according to the areas the app is operating and not one server, this could bring up cost but will not be a single point of failure and this type of applications could be run on a low powered server like a raspberry pi.</span></p></div></div>
